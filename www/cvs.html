<!--#set var="title" value="CVS Access" -->
<!--#include virtual="/header.html" -->

<p>The gedasymbols.org web site uses CVS to manage its pages.  This
allows for multiple admins as well as multiple contributors, and
contributors need not wait for admins to post their files.  To obtain
CVS clients or learn more about CVS, visit <a
href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/"> the CVS page</a>.</p>

<h2>Accessing the CVS repository without an account</h2>

<p>This will allow you to download the contents of the web site
without needing write access.  There's not a lot of reason for the
general public to need this, but it comes with the system and the
instructions are mostly the same as for those with accounts.</p>

<p>To access the repository, you'll need to set the <tt>CVSROOT</tt>
environment variable as in these examples (if you are using a
different shell, you'll have to figure it out yourself):</p>

<pre>
95/NT	set    CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gedasymbols.org:/cvs/gedasymbols
bash	export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gedasymbols.org:/cvs/gedasymbols
csh	setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@cvs.gedasymbols.org:/cvs/gedasymbols
</pre>

<p>Once you've done that, you need to tell your local cvs software
what password to use.  The password is the word
<tt>anonymous</tt>:</p>

<pre>
bash$ cvs login
(Logging in to anonymous@cvs.gedasymbols.org)
CVS password: <i>anonymous</i>
</pre>

<p><em>Note:</em> Windows users may need to make sure the
<tt>HOME</tt> environment variable is set to something meaningful.</p>

<p>After this, you shouldn't have to worry about passwords any more,
as it will store your password in <tt>$HOME/.cvspass</tt>
(semi-encoded).  In other words, don't type "<tt>cvs login</tt>"
again.</p>

<p>To get the web site files, do this:

<pre>
bash$ cvs get .
</pre>

<p>This will populate the CURRENT directory with the files.  You
probably want to create an empty directory and "cd" to it before
running this command.</p>

<p>Once you have a "working copy" of the files, you can obtain any
updates by running "cvs update", which will only download the files
that have changed.  If you want to contribute changes to existing
files, just make your changes locally and run "cvs diff" and mail the
output to someone who can apply them.</p>

<h2>Accessing the CVS repository with an account</h2>

<p>This is for people who maintain portions of the web site.  The
instructions are similar to those above, but you replace the word
"anonymous" in CVSROOT with your cvs account name, and the password
"anonymous" obviously gets replaced with your cvs account password.
After checking out the files with "cvs get", you make your changes and
run "cvs commit" to copy the changes back to the web site.  Please use
a meaningful log message!  There's a mailing list where all the log
messages and changes are sent, so at least a few words saying why
you're changing it would be valuable.  To add a new file, use "cvs add
<i>filename</i>" then "cvs commit".</p>

<p>To get a cvs account, <a href="mailto:dj@delorie.com">email DJ</a>.
Accounts will be given to those who have demonstrated good skill and
judgement on the public gEDA mailing lists, and abuse of these
priviledges will result in your account being cancelled.  We're still
new at this, so these rules may change in the future.</p>

<p>Account names will be of the form <tt>firstname_lastname</tt> (mine
is <tt>dj_delorie</tt> for example).  If you have an existing checked
out tree that you got as "anonymous" you will probably have to delete
that tree and check it out again with your new account name, as the
tree remembers the initial account name and you'll have problems
committing files.</p>

<p>Please read <a href="style.html">The Page Editing Style Guide</a>
before creating or committing any content.</p>

<p>Note that CVS traffic is NOT encrypted in any way, so your password
will be assigned and you won't be able to change it.  This keeps you
from using the same password as some other one and possibly causing
security problems.</p>
