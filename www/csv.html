<p>Comma-separated files are gedasymbols' way of managing tabular
data, specifically the mapping between symbols and footprints.  CSV
files are readily importable into many spreadsheet and database
programs.</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>First off, you must name your files with a <tt>.csv</tt> suffix.
Doing so causes the web server to read the CSV file and format it for
web viewing.  Within the CSV file, there are four types of lines, which,
if present, must be in this order:

<ol>

<li> If the first line of the file has neither a comma nor an equals
     sign, it is the title of the file and is used as the title of the
     web page.

<li> Next, any lines which do not have commas yet have equals signs
     are parsed as name/value pairs, and are assumed to be "constant
     value columns".  This means you don't have to repeat the same
     value over and over, for each row.

<li> The remaining lines are true CSV lines.  The first such line must
     contain the column headers.  See below for standard column names.

<li> All remaining lines are CSV data rows.  Each row is assumed to
correspond to one specific part, tying together the symbol, footprint,
value, manufacturer, mfg part number, vendor, vendor part number, pdf
file, etc.


</ol>

<h2>Standard Column Names</h2>

<p>There are a couple of column names which have special meaning to
the web server, or are defined specially so that we can have some
consistency.  Names are case sensitive.  These are:

<dl>

<dt> <b>symbol</b> <dd> The value in this column is a symbol file name,
normally one present in your area.  If it ends in <tt>.sym</tt>, it is
printed without it.  If it does not end in <tt>.sym</tt>, the file in
your area is assumed to end in it.  Thus, you can add the
<tt>.sym</tt> or not, and you get the same results.  If the file
referred to by this symbol exists in your area, a hyperlink to that
symbol will be created for this value.

<dt> <b>footprint</b> <dd> Likewise, for footprints, and <tt>.fp</tt>.

<dt> <b>value</b> <dd> The value of the part, like 1k or 0.47uF.  This
corresponds to the "value" field in the footprints.

<dt> <b>description</b> <dd> A description of the part.  Watch out for
commas in the description; use double quotes around the description if
you need to include a comma.

<dt> <b>manufacturer</b> <dd> Manufacturer

<dt> <b>manufacturer_part_number</b> <dd> Manufacturer part number, if it isn't already
in value or description.

<dt> <b>vendor</b> <dd> Where this part can be ordered from; usually
used in conjunction with the Part Number (below).

<dt> <b>vendor_part_number</b> <dd> The part number, usually for the vendor
(Digikey, for example).

<dt> <b>author</b> <dd> Your name.  This is usually a constant-value
column.

<dt> <b>email</b> <dd> Your email.

<dt> <b>price</b> <dd> I don't expect people to use this field in
public files, but I'm reserving this name (vs "Cost" or some other
name) for utilities to use to tally project costs.

</dl>

<h2>Planning for the Future</h2>

<p>My thoughts on this are, at some point these tables might get used
to provide <tt>gattrib</tt> or <tt>gsch2pcb</tt> with the information
they need to help you match up symbols, footprints, and real parts.
So, keep this in mind, and make sure your information is consistent
enough to serve this purpose (i.e. if your 1k resistors are always
"1k", you may only get one copy of that value in a menu choice).</p>

<p>Just a thought ;-)</p>
