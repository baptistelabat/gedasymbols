<h3>Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) Glyphs for PCB</H3>

The Chinese, Japanese and Korean glyphs were generated from the GNU Unifont project's .bdf file. A .bdf file is a text based font description file for X-windows systems.

The GNU Unifont project added CJK glyphs from the freely available FireFly CJK font.

The highest resolution 16x16 bitmapped CJK glyphs were converted into PCB line primitives to create symbols that can be mapped to keyboard characters.

These symbols have been developed to allow users to have some Chinese, Japanese or Korean glyphs on their pcb until such time that pcb gets unicode support.

Users will need to determine the unicode for the particular glyph(s) that they require and extract the corresponding glyph symbol description from the tarball. The symbol for the particular glyph can then be mapped to a keyboard character, allowing the glyph to be typed within PCB with that particular keyboard character. Obvious limitations of this approach include the limited number of ASCII characters available for remapping, but it's arguably better than nothing, or converting bitmaps of CJK glyphs with pstoedit.
