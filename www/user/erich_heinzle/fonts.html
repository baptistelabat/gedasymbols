<h3>Alternative fonts for PCB</H3>

The following fonts have been generated as a drop in replacement for the file "default_font" in the git source directory "pcb/src". Alternatively, a text editor can be used to replace the default font portion of the .pcb design file with the text description of the preferred font. 

Cyrillic, Hebrew and Greek have glyph tables and users will need to decide how they map the characters to their keyboards. If PCB acquires some form of unicode support, this will no longer be necessary.
<P>
The gothic, cyrillic, greek and sans fonts are from the freely available single stroke Hershey fonts.
<P>
The hebrew font was generated from the freely availble Gnu unifont project's .bdf file.
