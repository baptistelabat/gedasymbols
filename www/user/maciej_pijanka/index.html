<p>Beware, <a href="slantizer.pl">Font Slantizer</a> can slantize your font, both forward and reverse <i>-r</i>, but, its not very smart tool, can not detect that ltetter was already slantized, and i didn't tried to make sure that forward then reverse slantize will return to normal state of font.</p>
