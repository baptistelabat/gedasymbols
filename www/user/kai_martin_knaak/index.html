<h2>General remarks</h2>
The catalog of symbols and footprints presented here is self consistent.
That is, the default footprint attribute of a symbol points
to one of the footprints given in the footprint section.

<p>Note: All my symbols, footprints and scripts are licensed GPL 2 or GPL 3 for 
distribution, and unlimited for use. See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">http://www.gnu.org/licenses.gpl.txt</a>
for the details</p>


<h2>New Project Script</h2>
<a href="new_geda_project.sh">new_geda_project.sh</a> is a little convinience
script to starting a new geda project. When given a project name, it creates
a simple directory structure and populates it with some config files (gafrc,
attribs). In addition, it copies a <a href ="doku_template.lyx">documentation template</a>
in lyx format to the directory.

<h2>Scripted pcb layout print</h2>
The bash script <a href="layoutdruck.sh">layoutdruck.sh</a> uses actions on the 
command line of pcb to produce a set of printouts for use in documentation. 
These include a multi page PDF with top and bottom layout, each with values and with 
refdes. The layout can be spread between several sheets for large layouts.

<p>In addition photo realistic PNG export of top and bottom side is produced. A drop
shadow is added to the PNG to make the image even more photo realistic.

<p>Note, there is a bug in pcb that prevents the execution of actions when printing
from the command line. This script needs a bug patch of pcb not yet applied to the 
distributed version of pcb.

<h2>PDF of all schematics in a hierarchy</h2>
The bash script <a href="schaltplandruck.sh">schaltplandruck.sh</a> uses print.scm 
from the gnetlist distribution and ps2pdf to create output. It recursively descends
into subsheets of a hierarchy and collects prints every unique schematic it encounters.

<h2>More convenience scripts</h2>
<ol>  
<li> <a href="set_pinnumber.awk">set_pinnumber.awk</a>: Emits the footprint file 
given on the command line with the value of all pin and pad names set to the 
value of their number. Requires awk.
<li> <a href="set_name_value_description.sh">set_name_value_description.sh</a>:
Sets name, value and description to the same string. I use this for footprint
collections in the library.
<li> <a href="find-missing-symbols.sh">find-missing-symbols.sh</a>: Searches all 
*.sch in $PWD and sub dirs for missing symbols.
<li> <a href="extract_footprints.sh">extract_footprints.sh</a>: Extracts all 
footprints of a layout and writes them to individual files in the currrent 
working directory.
<li> <a href="collect_gedaconfs.sh">collect_gedaconfs.sh</a>: Collects the config files 
in $HOME/.gEDA and $HOME/.pcb into a compressed tar file. The path to the color 
file is absolute. It contains the path to the home directory of the user, who 
runs the script. 
</ol>

<h3> Templates
<ul>
   <li> <a href="footprints/footprint_template.pcb"> footprint_template.pcb</a>
 - a template for footprint design</li>
</ul>
</h3>

<h2>Symbols</h2>
The symbols in this sections are designed according to the following design criteria:
<ol>
	<li>they contain a default footprint attribute.
	<li>the footprint attribute is visible on the schematic and printed
	with a smaller font size than the refdes and the value of the symbol.
	<li>they contain a human readable description
	<li>power pins of integrated circuits are split off to a seperate power symbol
	<li>pin numbers are hidden, if they follow a generally accepted standard
</ol>
