Subject: Autocrop() plugin for PCB

As a "learn PCB internals" project I've written an Autocrop() plugin.
It finds the extents of your existing board and resizes the board to
contain only your parts plus a margin.

There are some issues that I can't resolve from a plugin:

1)  Board size has no Undo function, so while Undo will put your objects
back where they started, the board size has to be replaced manually.

2)  There is no 'edge clearance' DRC paramater, so I used 5*line spacing.

3)  Moving a layout with lots of objects and polygons is slow due to the
repeated clearing/unclearing of the polygons as things move.  Undo is
slower than moving because every individual move is drawn (instead of
one redraw at the end).

The source is:

http://ad7gd.net/geda/autocrop.c

And you compile/install with:

# set PCB to your PCB source directory
PCB=$(HOME)/cvs/pcb
gcc -I$(PCB) -I$(PCB)/src -O2 -shared autocrop.c -o autocrop.so
cp autocrop.so ~/.pcb/plugins

Run it by typing `:Autocrop()' in the gui, or by binding Autocrop() to a
key.
