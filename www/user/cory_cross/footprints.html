See all my footprints in the <a href="footprints/">footprints/</a> directory.<br>All my footprints should have a meaningful description, have the 0,0 coordinate in the center of the part, and be used on a board before I post them up here. If the part was automatically generated (usually obvious from the filename), I may not have used that exact one, but one of the series has been used on a board and shown to be correct.<br>
Rather than browse my footprints, it's probably best to search for them (since it searches my nice descriptions too).
