<h2>Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li> <a href="tools/footprint_generator.py">footprint_generator.py</a> - Python script to generate footprints automatically from a list of dimensions. Currently only includes SMT caps, little documentation so far. I will update soon, as I'm using this tool right now. Software architecture consists of all generators in this one file, and the user interface (command-line,text,GUI) is subclassed or otherwise uses it. Users can develop their own generator against mine by subclassing before offering it for submission, without worrying about merging any changes I develop in the mean time.
