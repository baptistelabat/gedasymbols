I have two different pcb programs installed now.
<br>

For one, I used    <br>
.configure --prefix=/opt/pcbhead  --enable-maintainer-mode    <br>
make    <br>
make install    <br> 


and PATH leads to both /opt/pcb/bin:/opt/pcbhead/bin    <br>


The other installed PCB was made with    <br>
./configure --prefix=/opt/pcb  --disable-doc --with-gui=lesstif    <br>
make    <br>
make install    <br>


Since the pcb executable is a script containing hard-coded paths to     <br>
executable parts of PCB, I renamed /opt/pcbhead/bin/pcb to     <br>
/opt/pcbhead/bin/pcbhead and now I can excute pcb or pcbhead     <br>
from any dir on my workstation.     <br>
