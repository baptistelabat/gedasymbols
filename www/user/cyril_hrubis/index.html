<h2>Pcb Utils</h2>
Is footprint generator library that will do all the hard work while creating
footprint as well as it's collection of footprint generators.

<h3>Description</h3>
The library is written in C and consist of core library along with footprint
generators and bash wrappers that passes default parameters to generators in
order to create all possible footprints. You can obtain all possible footprints
just by typing 'make' in root directory of project sources.
<br>
<br>
So what can it really handle?
<ul>
<li>Unit conversion.</li>
<li>Basic geometric shapes.</li>
<li>Electronic symbols.</li>
<li>Pcb backend.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
The most basic example of code for footprint generator in C. We are creating
footprint for generic smt diode.

<pre>
#include "fpg_common.h"

int main(void)
{
	/* 
	 * Print backend generated data to stdout
	 */
	fpg_set_file(stdout);

	/*
	 * We are working with micro meters.
	 *
	 * NOTE: the library works with integer numbers
	 *       passed as arguments.
	 */
	fpg_set_units(fpg_um);

	/*
	 * Set line thickness.
	 */
	fpg_set_line_thickness(500);

	/*
	 * Start element with description
	 */
	fpg_element_begin("Diode");

	/*
	 * create two pins
	 */
	fpg_pin_default(0, 0, "Pin_1", "1", "square");
	fpg_pin_default(10000, 0, "Pin_2", "2", "");

	/*
	 * Draw generic diode betwen pins.
	 */
	fpg_diode(0, 0, 10000, 0, FPG_DIODE_GEN);
	
	/*
	 * Close element.
	 */
	fpg_element_end();
}
</pre>

<h3>Download</h3>
The library is distributed under GPLv2 and I really would like to see and merge your patches ;).
<br>
Download first published version <a href="http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~metan/outgoing/pcb_utils.tar.bz2">here</a>

<h3>Help wanted</h3>
The goal here is to create collection of footprint generators that can generate
all the footprints that you will ever need. Why geneators? Why not just the
footprints? Yes I could just create some missing footprints and add them here
but with every small change I'll end up changing all the files. Generators are
written backend independend, so If we need to change format of output files
it's just a few lines. In shorter words it's just much more universal solution.
<br>
<br>
Note: 
<i>
The library is in alpha state, all comment and patches are welcome.  The api
may change a bit so page describing all usable functions is not here right now.
Stay tuned.
