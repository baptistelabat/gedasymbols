The <tt>djboxsym</tt> program is a tool for quickly producing a gschem
symbol from a minimal description.  Yes, it's like tragesym,
with a few differences:

<ul>
<li> You don't use gnumeric (or any other spreadsheet).
<li> the symbols are in my "compromise" format.
<li> No DRC support (use my <a href="sym2csv">sym2csv</a>/<a href="csv2sym">csv2sym</a> programs for that).
<li> Supports packed bus pins.
<li> It's in perl instead of python<tt> ;-)</tt>
</ul>

<p>Download: <tt><a href="djboxsym">djboxsym</a></tt></p>

<p>FYI there's even <a href="http://vivara.net/cgi-bin/djboxsym.cgi">online
symbol creator</a> using djboxsym!</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<pre>
$ djboxsym myfile.symdef > myfile.sym
</pre>

<p>A table of all pin information will be printed to stderr.  Note
that labels are assigned negative pins internally, and show up in the
table that way.</p>

<p>The symdef file is a simple text file, with sections denoted by
<tt>[section]</tt> markers.  Here's <a href="sample.symdef">a sample
file</a> and <a href="sample.sym">the symbol it generates</a> (note:
the edge triggers were added for demonstration purposes).  Each
section will be documented separately, but the program doesn't care
what order the sections are in, and you can list each section multiple
times - the program will treat it as if the contents of each section
were concatenated.

<p>Any line that begins with <tt>#</tt> (pound/hash symbol) is
ignored.  Otherwise, leading and trailing spaces are trimmed, and
other whitespace is treated as if it were a single space.

<h2>Options</h2>

Lines beginning with '--' are considered options.  Options should be
given before any pins are listed.  Currently these options are
supported:

<dl>

<dt> <tt>--vmode</tt>

<dd> Vertical mode - pin labels for pins along the top and bottom edge
of the symbol will be drawn vertically, rather than the default
horizontally.

</dl>

<h2><tt>[labels]</tt></h2>

<p>The labels section is for textual labels and attributes that aren't
associated with any pins.  Each line in this section corresponds to a
single label.  The label may be preceeded by a <tt>!</tt> (exclamation
mark) to make the label invisible by default.</p>

<p>If the label is of the form <tt>name=value</tt> it is assumed to be
an attribute, and the <tt>name=</tt> portion will be hidden.  Visible
labels are placed in the center of the symbol.  Invisible labels are
placed outside the upper right corner of the symbol.

<h2><tt>[left]</tt></h2>

One line per pin on the left side of the symbol.  Each pin line is
of the form:

<pre>
pinnumber [opt-flags] pinlabel
</pre>

<p>The optional flags may be <tt>!</tt> (exclamation point) to include an
inversion bubble on the pin, and/or <tt>&gt;</tt> (greater than) to
include an edge-trigger on the pin.</p>

<p>In addition to pin lines, there are two "special" lines.  First,
any blank line between pins causes a gap to be included between those
pins in the symbol.  Second, a line with only <tt>.bus</tt> on it
causes the next group of pins (up to the next line) to be spaced
closer together (bus spacing).

<p>Pins should be listed in the order you want them to appear on the
symbol, from top to bottom.</p>

<h2><tt>[right]</tt></h2>

Like for the left side, but for the right side.

<h2><tt>[top]</tt></h2>

Like for the left side, but for the top.  Note that <tt>.bus</tt> is
not allowed here.  Pins should be listed in left to right order.
Blank lines are ignored, as pins are spaced according to the width of
their labels.

<h2><tt>[bottom]</tt></h2>

Like for the top, but for the bottom.

<h2><tt>[nc]</tt></h2>

<p>List any pins that have no connection here; one pin number per line
(no flags or labels).  The program will ensure that all pins are
listed exactly once each; this section lets you list pins that would
otherwise be considered missing.</p>
