<p>Once you have <a href="cvs.html">a CVS account</a>, your area of
the web site will be <tt>/user/<i>account</i>/</tt>.  For example,
mine is <a href="/user/dj_delorie/"><tt>/user/dj_delorie/</tt></a>.
You will not be able to change files outside your area.  Of course, if
you find that you *can*, let me know, because that's probably a
bug.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first thing you should do is create an index.html file
that says who you are and how to contact you.  Any footprints you
upload should end in <tt>.fp</tt> and if you link directly to them,
the server does the right thing automatically.  Likewise, symbols end
in <tt>.sym</tt> although I don't have an automatic symbol handler
yet.  See below for how to encode author and copyright information
into symbols and footprints.</p>

<p>When I notice your area has content, I'll add a link to it from the
top page so that others can find it.</p>

<p>All html pages should use the global gedasymbols style.  Look at
the sources to other pages to see how it's being done.  To use the
global style, your html files should all start like this:

<pre>
&lt;!--#set var="title" value="Meaningful Title" --&gt;
&lt;!--#include virtual="/header.html" --&gt;

</pre>

Note that the index.html in your /user/ directory should have just
your full name as the title, nothing else, as the server automatically
reads those to generate the list of contributors.  The last line in
your HTML files should be this:

<pre>

&lt;!--#include virtual="/trailer.html" --&gt;
</pre>

Other than that, you should avoid using HTML constructs that change
the appearance of the page (i.e. <tt>&lt;P&gt;</tt> is OK, but don't use
<tt>align=center</tt> or any <tt>font</tt> or <tt>color</tt> tags.).</p>

<p>There are four basic types of files that are appropriate for gedasymbols.org:

<ul>
<li> symbol/footprint/conversion related tools
<li> symbol/footprint/conversion related documentation
<li> gschem symbols
<li> pcb footprints
</ul>

To keep things consistent, please list your files in that order on
your index page.  Also, the convention for subdirectories (if you have
enough files to warrant them) is:

<ul>
<li> <tt>/user/<i>account</i>/tools/</tt> for tools
<li> <tt>/user/<i>account</i>/docs/</tt> for documentation
<li> <tt>/user/<i>account</i>/symbols/</tt> for symbols
<li> <tt>/user/<i>account</i>/footprints/</tt> for footprints
</ul>

<h2>Copyrights</h2>

<p>You, as the author, get to pick the terms under which your symbols
are distributed and used.  Note that putting them on gedasymbols.org
implies a license for gedasymbols.org to distribute them according to
the way web servers (and clients, search engines, etc) work.</p>

<p>For symbols, you should include invisible text attributes that
specify your name, email, and distribution and licence terms.  For
footprints, include comments (any line beginning with <tt>#</tt> is a
comment).  Always use the keywords given below, so that in the future
I can write an indexer of some sort (the automatic footprint web page
handler already uses these).  Examples, showing appropriate keywords,
for symbols and footprints respectively, follow:

<pre>
T . . .
author=DJ Delorie
T . . .
email=dj@delorie.com
T . . .
dist-license=GPL
T . . .
use-license=unlimited
</pre>

<pre>
# author: DJ Delorie
# email: dj@delorie.com
# dist-license: GPL 2
# use-license: unlimited
Element[ . . . ]
</pre>

<p>Note that "dist-license" is the license under which the files may
be redistributed in some form whereby they can be used for other
projects.  Since gEDA uses open formats, this includes distributing
project files.  The "use-license" covers boards made using the
symbols, so if you say "personal" here, that means the person can't
sell those boards.</p>

<p>For the automatic symbol and footprint handlers, if the first word
in the license matches <a href="/licenses/">a license web page</a> a
link will be created automatically (i.e. "GPL" above would link to
GPL.html).  Also, the email address will be linked automatically, and
http-style links will be automatically converted.</p>
